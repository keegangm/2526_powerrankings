251107_CBS_OKC,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,1,Oklahoma City Thunder,251103,"There's really not much we can say. The Thunder won 68 games and the title -- and they could be even more dangerous this season. The only knock on them to start the year is Jalen Williams' injury, but Mark Daigneault has proven time and time again that he will pull someone off the bench who more than adequately fills the gap. It's not hyperbole to say that 70-plus wins is in play."
251107_CBS_NYK,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,2,New York Knicks,251103,"Armed with a new, movement-heavy offense from Mike Brown, the Knicks should be in the hunt for the East's top seed throughout the season. By empowering Karl-Anthony Towns, Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby -- among others -- the pressure should be at least somewhat lifted off of Jalen Brunson's shoulders. If they can stay around average defensively, New York should win a lot of games."
251107_CBS_DEN,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,3,Denver Nuggets,251103,"This could be the best supporting cast Nikola Jokić has ever seen, and that should have defensive minds throughout the NBA contemplating another line of work. Cam Johnson will be a seamless fit as a floor-spacer and sneaky creator, while the additions of Bruce Brown, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jonas Valanciunas suggest the Denver offense might not completely drown when Jokić is on the bench. We'll see how the defense looks, but this team could lead the NBA in scoring."
251107_CBS_CLE,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,4,Cleveland Cavaliers,251103,"Sure they lost Ty Jerome, and Darius Garland is injured to start the year, but there's not much reason to think the Cavs won't be able to at least come close to replicating their magical 64-win run from last season. Donovan Mitchell is as reliable as they come, and Evan Mobley still has another level to hit offensively. Mostly, you have to trust Kenny Atkinson's system to make creative use of whichever players he has available. And when everyone's healthy -- look out."
251107_CBS_MIN,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,5,Minnesota Timberwolves,251103,"The way the Wolves ended last season is probably closer to their true selves than how they started it, with Julius Randle finally looking comfortable, and Anthony Edwards leading a top-three offense to complement their stout defense. Losing Nickeil Alexander-Walker hurts, and it means they'll need Rob Dillingham and/or Terrence Shannon Jr. to step up -- both definite possibilities."
251107_CBS_HOU,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,6,Houston Rockets,251103,"Fred VanVleet's injury is brutal, but it gives us an extended look at Amen Thompson as a primary creator -- and playing next to Kevin Durant significantly aids that effort. Reed Sheppard could also seize his moment, as we'll have to see if the Rockets miss the late-game organization and steady hand that VanVleet brings. Mostly, though, we're excited for the jumbo lineups Ime Udoka will throw out there."
251107_CBS_LAC,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,7,Los Angeles Clippers,251103,"Old guys rule! Or at least the Clippers hope so, as Chris Paul, Brook Lopez and Bradley Beal join Kawhi Leonard and James Harden on a team that becomes quite dangerous if it all comes together. Even with load management factored in, the Clippers should be an excellent regular-season team, particularly thanks to the acquisition of John Collins, who was sneaky good for Utah last season when he was permitted to play."
251107_CBS_ORL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,8,Orlando Magic,251103,"Orlando got exactly what it needed this offseason in Desmond Bane, a secondary creator who doubles as a low-maintenance knock-down spot-up shooter. Factoring in another expected leap from franchise players Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner, the Magic could realistically make a run at the No. 1 seed in the East. Injuries are always an issue, but this is a deep team full of capable NBA players."
251107_CBS_GSW,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,9,Golden State Warriors,251103,"Steve Kerr seems as confident going into this season as he has since the last Kevin Durant roster, and with good reason. The success to end last season, their belief that they would have beaten the Wolves in the playoffs had Steph Curry not been injured, and the offseason additions of Al Horford and De'Anthony Melton make the Warriors a dangerous and hungry bunch. The question is how often Curry, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green will take the floor together given their collective age would rank highly on the list of oldest living Americans."
251107_CBS_DET,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,10,Detroit Pistons,251103,"Many are predicting a Pistons regression (like, maybe a handful of wins -- not back to 68 losses), but Cade Cunningham is a genuine superstar and if Ausar Thompson makes the leap he seems primed for, it's hard to see them slipping that much in this season's Eastern Conference. A lot depends on Duncan Robinson assuming the majority of Malik Beasley's crucial role from last season, since he ... uh ... probably won't be back any time soon."
251107_CBS_LAL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,11,Los Angeles Lakers,251103,"Without LeBron James, the Lakers' early season begins and ends with Luka Dončić, who -- if you haven't heard -- is in possibly the best shape of his life. The rest of the roster abounds with question marks outside of Austin Reaves, but Dončić is a top-10 offense unto himself. Defense, however, will be a different story with some perimeter targets and new addition Deandre Ayton patrolling the paint."
251107_CBS_ATL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,12,Atlanta Hawks,251103,"The Hawks were designated offseason darlings for their shrewd acquisitions, and Trae Young finally has a cast around him that leaves no excuses for another trip to the Play-In. Kristaps Porziņģis gives Atlanta a stretch-five and rim-protector, while Jalen Johnson returns healthy to wreak the same kind of havoc he was inflicting before last season's injury issues. There's star power, depth, and potential for rapid development. This should be fun."
251107_CBS_DAL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,13,Dallas Mavericks,251103,"The theoretical Mavericks are a problem. The real-world Mavericks, with a rookie forward (albeit an incredible one) as the primary playmaker and a double-big frontcourt, have to prove how this is all going to work. Kyrie Irving's eventual return obviously makes the pieces fit much better, but that's a ways off. For now, Dallas remains an enigma until we see how it unfolds."
251107_CBS_MIL,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,14,Milwaukee Bucks,251103,"Even if you put the Giannis trade rumors aside, the Bucks are as hard to predict as any team in the East. With Damian Lillard gone, Antetokounmpo's next highest-paid teammates are now Myles Turner and Kyle Kuzma. Not exactly confidence-inspiring, but then you remember that Giannis is one of the four best basketball players in the world. So, in a disaster if an Eastern Conference, they could realistically end up with any seed from No. 3 to No. 8."
251107_CBS_PHI,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,15,Philadelphia 76ers,251103,"Anyone doing any sort of preseason rankings or predictions has to take a 15-minute mental break when it's time for the Sixers entry. On paper, they could be a top-three seed. If things break a certain way, however, they could miss the playoffs (again). As NBA fans, at least we can all agree that we want to see a healthy season from Joel Embiid -- whatever that looks like for him these days."
251107_CBS_SAS,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,16,San Antonio Spurs,251103,"Unprecedented levels of preseason excitement were realized as Victor Wembanyama dunked, pivoted and Eurostepped his way back into the hearts of NBA enthusiasts. His training at a Shaolin temple this summer clearly did the trick, as he looks as ferocious and inevitable as any dominant young prospect we've ever seen -- in a body that is now officially listed at 7-foot-4. Oh yeah, and the Spurs actually have a pretty good roster around him once De'Aaron Fox returns. If any team is going to make a leap into the Western Conference playoff picture, it's San Antonio."
251107_CBS_BOS,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,17,Boston Celtics,251103,"Sure, we may not know who's going to play the bulk of the frontcourt minutes, but we definitely know that Jaylen Brown and Derrick White are serious ballers who won't allow a team to be bad. Boston simply may lack the depth to make any real noise, but the not-so-quiet whispers of a potential Jayson Tatum return make things a whole lot more interesting."
251107_CBS_IND,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,18,Indiana Pacers,251103,"Tanking doesn't really seem to be in the cards for Indiana, despite the absence of Tyrese Haliburton for the entire season. They'll play hard and they have an identity, but how far can that get them? It's time for players like Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith to prove they can handle larger roles, while Pascal Siakam must remain his usual, steady self."
251107_CBS_MEM,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,19,Memphis Grizzlies,251103,"Probably not GREAT when all three of your point guards and two of your centers are injured to start the season, and it will put even more pressure on Jaren Jackson Jr. to basically do it all on both ends of the floor. Memphis has a knack for getting the most out of its (sometimes little-known) bench mob, so we'll see if that's the case this time around. At full strength they could be a contender, but we'll need to see it first."
251107_CBS_MIA,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,20,Miami Heat,251103,"Tyler Herro's injury is a serious blow, but this roster is full of interesting players next to three-time All-Star Bam Adebayo. We don't quite know what to make of them yet, but Erik Spoelstra has earned the benefit of the doubt that Miami will compete and stay in the mix in a weak Eastern Conference."
251107_CBS_TOR,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,21,Toronto Raptors,251103,"If you had Toronto's starting five (Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett, Brandon Ingram, Scottie Barnes and Jakob Poeltl) on your fantasy team, you'd be buzzing heading into this season. In reality, however, it's hard to see how the pieces are going to fit together offensively, and how they're going to cobble together a passable defense. That being said, the talent is there, and -- especially in this era of tankdom -- you have to credit a team for going for it."
251107_CBS_NOP,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,22,New Orleans Pelicans,251103,"Skinny Zion! Trey Murphy! Poole Party! Healthy Herb! There's a lot to be excited about as a Pelicans fan, particularly given how depressing things were last season. Williamson's health is the obvious X-factor, and they might be asking a lot of players like Jordan Hawkins, Saddiq Bey (remember him?), Jeremiah Fears and Derik Queen (when healthy). Perhaps when Dejounte Murray comes back New Orleans will get spicy, but until then the Pels simply can't contend in the West."
251107_CBS_POR,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,23,Portland Trail Blazers,251103,"Portland hopes that its fourth-ranked defense after the All-Star break was no mirage, and that the acquisition of Jrue Holiday will provide steadiness and mentorship for its young core. Offensively, though ... yeah it's gonna be rough. The Blazers will need a serious leap from Shaedon Sharpe, Deni Avdija and/or Scoot Henderson (when he returns) in order to score enough points to get where they want to be in the West."
251107_CBS_CHI,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,24,Chicago Bulls,251103,"Bulls fans who think they won the Josh Giddey-Alex Caruso trade were happy to see their prodigal son return this offseason, and he'll steer a roster that has ""Play-In"" sealed onto its jerseys in red wax. Matas Buzelis provides legitimate cause for excitement, but other than that it looks like the same ol' Bulls being rolled out there once again."
251107_CBS_SAC,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,25,Sacramento Kings,251103,"Looking at the Kings roster feels like you put your contact lenses in the wrong eyes. If you squint really hard you can kind of see something, but overall it's just messy, unfocused and frustrating. Now with Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Murray both out to start the season, it's even worse than we imagined. Things could go south really quickly for Sacramento this season, and there are strong enough personalities on the team that things could get quite volatile chemistry-wise."
251107_CBS_PHO,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,26,Phoenix Suns,251103,"Jalen Green being out to start the season might be a blessing in disguise, as it will give Devin Booker full control of the show as the Suns attempt to get their footing. Counterpoint: Who the hell is going to score besides Devin Booker? Another 70-point outburst might not be out of the question, while Phoenix is going to have to rely on its defense (*cough* 27th in the NBA last season *cough*), at least until Green returns and perhaps much longer."
251107_CBS_CHA,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,27,Charlotte Hornets,251103,"Let's just take the optimistic approach and say LaMelo Ball is healthy all season. Ball, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, Kon Knueppel and Center-by-Committee certainly looks like a unit that could make a Play-In push in the depleted Eastern Conference. The bench isn't terrible, either, with Collin Sexton, Tre Mann and veteran Grant Williams. Are we saying the Hornets are going to be this year's Pistons? Probably not, but there's more reason for hope than in recent years."
251107_CBS_WAS,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,28,Washington Wizards,251103,"What an odd assortment of basketball players the Wizards have assembled, and it's going to be quite an experiment to watch unfold. The idea is presumably to eventually trade CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton, but even if that happens this roster is full of young talent that needs reps to develop. How coach Brian Keefe doles out minutes will be interesting to monitor."
251107_CBS_UTA,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,29,Utah Jazz,251103,"Oh you're not tanking anymore? That's cute. Unfortunately, winning is still difficult even if you're not actively trying to lose. Lauri Markkanen is going to be trade bait all season long, while he plays alongside a roster full of teammates who either don't have or were very recently granted legal permission to consume alcohol. Last season Utah allowed an NBA-worst 119.4 points per 100 possessions, and there's no reason to think that number will improve given this roster."
251107_CBS_BRK,CBS,Colin Ward-Henninger,251107,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/,30,Brooklyn Nets,251103,"If watching Michael Porter Jr. and Cam Thomas get buckets is your love language, be sure to tune into a lot of Nets games this season. This is arguably one of the tankiest NBA teams that has ever tanked, so winning appears to be their enemy, but the development of their five 2025 first-round picks (Egor Demin, Nolan Traore, Drake Powell, Ben Saraf and Danny Wolf) will at least be something to follow."

Alex Caruso suffered a concussion in the season-opening double-overtime win over the Rockets. Cason Wallace missed the double-overtime win over the Pacers with a left knee issue. Isaiah Joe and Nikola Topic are still sidelined because of preseason injuries. Jalen Williams hasn't been cleared from his offseason wrist surgery. Chet Holmgren missed the Kings game with a back issue. But Gilgeous-Alexander keeps scoring -- 35, 55, 30, 23 and 31 points -- and the Thunder keep winning despite a depleted rotation.

Cleveland's defense has carried the team through the early part of the schedule while its offense is still down a few key players, but keep an eye on Evan Mobley. He has started the season with the highest usage rate of his career, a concerted effort from the Cavs to give him even more offensive responsibilities. -- Jamal Collier"", '']"

That has happened only six times in the Curry era. Three of those 20-point scorers were Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody and Jonathan Kuminga -- the best signal yet that this older team might be able to sustain the grind of an 82-game season through a leap from its youth. Kuminga, in particular, has impressed with his activity. He has 37 rebounds in five games, prompting Steve Kerr to say: ""The way he\'s rebounding, the way he\'s attacking the rim, that\'s what makes him special. When he\'s playing to that talent, to that ability, it changes our team."" Kerr labeled Kuminga a permanent starter Tuesday night. -- Slater', '']"

Perhaps playing the Heat and Celtics -- two of the peskier and active defensive teams to start the season -- has led to the inefficient offensive play. But they need to start building some sweat equity rather quickly. Can Karl-Anthony Towns shake off a quad injury to become the unguardable force he needs to be to unlock everything else for OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges? He\'s shooting just 40% (39 from 3 on six attempts). When asked how long it would be before he\'s 100%, he deflected: ""As long as we win, I don\'t care.

Murray is off to a spectacular start, averaging 30.3 points and 6.0 assists on .530/.429/.923 shooting splits.

Murray, who got off to a sluggish start last season, reported to training camp in phenomenal shape, which has been reflected in his aggressiveness attacking the paint.

Those opponents are also 9-for-10 on clutch free throws, with Jerami Grant hitting the game-winners (one unintentionally) after Aaron Gordon got caught with a bad foul on what would have been a very difficult shot with one second left on Friday.\n\n\nAfter recording triple-doubles in each of the Nuggets’ first four games, Nikola Jokić came one assist short of No. 5 on Friday. (Christian Braun missed an open 3 with 35 seconds left that would have given Jokić the triple-double and probably sealed the win for Denver.)

Fox’s eventual return should have the biggest effect on Stephon Castle, who ranks 12th in the league in time of possession at 6.3 minutes per game. The reigning Rookie of the Year has shot much better both inside the arc and from beyond, while also registering a free-throw rate of 62.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field, fifth highest among 137 players with at least 50 field goal attempts and up from 34.8 per 100 last season.\n\nComing up: After visiting the Lakers on Wednesday, the Spurs will play seven of their next eight games at home.

As is often the case with a Rudy-Gobert-anchored team, it’s about how the opponents shoot on 2-pointers outside the restricted area. In the three losses and including Reaves’ game-winner, the Lakers (x2) and Nuggets have shot 57-for-92 (62%) on those non-restricted-area 2s.\n\n\nRandle is off to an efficient start to the season, ranking third in true shooting percentage (68.7%) among 44 players with a usage rate of at least 25%.

That (34 points on 11-for-16 shooting, five assists) was Leonard’s best offensive game of the season, and he added six steals on the other end of the floor. He’s one of two players averaging at least 20 points on 50/40/90 shooting splits.\n\n\nThe Clippers’ two losses have been very different. On opening night, they allowed the Jazz to score more efficiently (129 points on 95 possessions) than they did in any game last season. At Golden State on Tuesday (when they had a rest advantage), the Clippers themselves scored just 79 on 89, the second-worst offensive performance for any team this season. That included only 17 points on 29 possessions with Chris Paul on the floor, and thoughts of a dominant second unit have not yet come to fruition, with the Clips struggling to score with the 21-year vet running the show.\n\n\nThe Clippers were 9 points per 100 possessions better at home than on the road last season — the league’s biggest differential.

They followed that with wins over the Magic and Mavs, committing just 22 turnovers total. Cade Cunningham had zero turnovers (for just the seventh time in his career) against Orlando and just one (with a career-high 18 assists) against Dallas. He hasn’t shot well (career-low effective field goal percentage of 44.6%), but Cunningham has been making plays.\n\n\nDouble-bigs are a thing now, so the Pistons have brought back the combination of Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart, who played just eight total minutes together last season. They’ve played 23 minutes together this year, with the Pistons allowing just 50 points on 51 defensive possessions in those minutes. There was also an offensive possession against the Cavs on Monday where Duren handled the ball in a pick-and-roll, with his drive eventually leading to a catch-and-shoot 3 for Stewart.\n\n\nEven with one big man on the floor, the Pistons are dominating inside. They’ve outscored their opponents by 16.3 points per game, the league’s second biggest differential, in the restricted area.

They did limit attempts in those games (just 30% of their opponents’ total shots), but couldn’t continue to do so in their home-and-home set with the Knicks.

But they have outperformed their shot quality (which ranks 28th, according to tracking data) and rank in the top 10 in each of the other four factors on offense.\n\n\nAll those comebacks require the Sixers’ scorers to play to the wire, and Tyrese Maxey (42.4), VJ Edgecombe (38.9) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (38.1) rank first, second and fourth in minutes per game.

The Heat have been outscored by nearly 29 points per 100 possessions (allowing 133 per 100) in 48 minutes with Ware and Bam Adebayo on the floor together, but are a plus-24 per 100 (allowing just 98.3 per 100) in Adebayo’s 157 minutes as the lone big.\n\n\nTheir loss in San Antonio on Thursday was the Heat’s slowest-paced and worst offensive game of the season. They registered just 19 transition points after averaging 35.8 through their first three games. They got back on the run (41 transition points) in L.A. on Sunday, but couldn’t get stops.\n\n\nTheir defense still ranks third, though it’s yielded a lot of corner 3s. The percentage of their opponents’ shots that have come from 3-point range and the percentage of their opponents’ 3-point attempts that have come from the corners are both top-five rates. It’s a pace-aided number to an extent, but the 13 corner 3-point attempts per game that the Heat have allowed would be the most for any team in the 30 seasons for which we have shot-location data.\n\nComing up: The Heat’s loss to the Lakers on Sunday was the start of their first stretch of five games in seven days, which will take them from coast to coast.

The new group outscored opponents by 25 points in 37 minutes over the winning streak, despite shooting just 9-for-32 from 3-point range. The overall numbers aren’t as good as those of the original lineup, but the Celtics have rebounded much better with Minott on the floor than they have otherwise.\n\n\nAs was the case in the preseason, the Celtics have seen the league’s biggest jump in average pick-up distance on defense.

Battle is basically the Raptors’ 12th man and played two minutes two nights later against Memphis. It’s unlikely that he’ll ever shoot 6-for-6 from deep again, but the Raptors may just need Battle to be a more regular part of the rotation to help with their spacing and 3-point rate (which ranks 25th).\n\nComing up: Having played four of their last five games against the Western Conference, the Raptors will now play 14 straight within the East.

They hit nine more 3-pointers than the Spurs on Sunday, and they’re one of two teams – the Bucks are the other – that haven’t been outscored from 3-point range this season. They’ve seen both a big jump in their own 3-point rate and a big drop in their opponents’ rate.\n\n\nWith the departures of Bradley Beal and Kevin Durant, Devin Booker has seen only small jumps in time of possession (4.9 to 5.1 minutes per game) and usage rate (28.5% to 30.1%) from last season. He scored 28 points and dished out 13 assists against San Antonio and is registering career-best marks in both effective field goal percentage (58.9%) and free throw rate (45.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field).\n\n\nMark Williams had already been closing games, and he replaced Oso Ighodaro in the starting lineup on Wednesday. Regarding box score numbers, Williams had a relatively quiet weekend after totaling 45 points over his previous two games. But he’s got a Jokić-esque on-off differential, with the Suns having been 26.9 points per 100 possessions better with Williams on the floor (plus-11.3) than they’ve been with him off the floor (minus-15.6).\n\nComing up: In Week 1, the Suns allowed the Clippers to score 129 points on just 97 possessions, easily LA’s most efficient offensive performance thus far.

The Jazz were back in town on Sunday, and the Hornets won by 23 without their point guard. James and Knueppel combined to shoot 7-for-14 from beyond the arc, marking the third time this season that the Hornets scored more than 124 points per 100 possessions.

Six of their seven games (including all three wins) have been determined by at least 16 points.\n\nComing up: The Hornets have a league-high 18 *multi-day breaks (not including the All-Star break) this season, with their second and third coming this week when they’ll play on just Tuesday and Friday.

And he came through with a career-high 25 points, six rebounds, 10 assists (with no turnovers) and three steals on Saturday. He had two of the three biggest buckets of the night, a catch-and-shoot 3 for the lead, and an impressive, isolation pull-up against Draymond Green to seal the win. In a five-point victory, the Pacers outscored Golden State by 20 points in Jackson’s 31 minutes.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, Pascal Siakam’s efficiency has taken a hit, with his true shooting percentage of 51.9% being the lowest mark of his career. And not surprisingly, the Pacers’ offense still depends heavily on Siakam, as they’ve scored just 95.3 points per 100 possessions (and been outscored by 24.2 per 100) in his 87 minutes on the bench.\n\n\nThe Pacers still rank in the top five in both ball and player movement for what would be the sixth straight season.

They’re at minus-14.0 per game through six games this season, with four of their five losses having come by 13 points or more.

The first stints for the Wizards’ new starters were solid in that game and again against the Magic over the weekend, but what little success they had was fleeting.\n\n\nThe Wizards blew a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead against Philadelphia on Tuesday and scored just eight points on 16 clutch possessions. CJ McCollum shot 0-for-4 with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, getting blocked on a drive for the lead at the end of regulation. The 13-year vet is registering career-low marks in both effective field goal percentage (46.8%) and true shooting percentage (50.2%), but the Wizards have still scored 17.4 more points per 100 possessions with McCollum on the floor (111.2) than they have with him on the bench (93.8).\n\nComing up: The only team with a worse free-throw differential than Washington is the Celtics, who the Wizards will visit on Wednesday.

Their opponents’ 3-point shooting (43.3%) is probably unsustainable, though the percentage of their opponents’ 3-point attempts that have been wide-open (58%) is well above the league average (53%).\n\n\nBad defense starts in transition, and the Nets have allowed 35.3 transition points per game, a lot more than any team has allowed in the previous 21 seasons of Synergy tracking. (The record is 29.7 transition points per game allowed by last season’s Jazz.) Three of their six opponents (including the Rockets and Sixers last week) have topped the 40-point mark in transition.\n\n\nThe offense has been pretty good (123.2 points scored per 100 possessions) in Ben Saraf’s 91 minutes on the floor, but the rookie was DNP’d on Sunday after starting the first five games. Fellow rookie Egor Dëmin continues to come off the bench and has been limited to about 20 minutes per game. After taking all of his first 23 shots from 3-point range, he attempted two inside the arc on Sunday, scoring over Andre Drummond in the first quarter.\n\nComing up: The Nets will get a shot at the league’s 29th-ranked offense in Indiana on Wednesday.

The 24-year-old has missed exactly three games in each of the last three seasons, with the Wolves going 5-4 in those games. They had scored just 37 points on 45 offensive possessions (82 per 100) with him off the floor in their first two games, but survived his absence on Sunday.\n\n\nThe Wolves were 20-26 in clutch games last season, but are 2-0 this year, having shot 9-for-13 (including 3-for-4 from 3-point range) with their wins over the Blazers and Pacers within five points in the last five minutes. Eleven different Wolves (including designated inbounder Joe Ingles) played in clutch time over the two wins.\n\n\nThe Lakers had the fourth-worst offense in the first round of the 2025 playoffs, when they lost to Minnesota in five games. But their 128 points on 93 possessions on Friday were the most efficient offensive performance for any team in Week 1. The Wolves had no answer for Luka Dončić, who scored 49 points on 14-for-23 shooting.\n\nComing up: The Wolves will be at a rest disadvantage when they host the Nuggets on Monday. Edwards averaged 31.5 points on an effective field goal percentage of 61.3% as the Wolves scored 124.3 points per possession (the best mark against Denver among West opponents) and swept the season series last season.\nWeek 2: vs. DEN, vs. LAL, @ CHA']"

Anything less than a trip to the NBA Finals could prompt a breakup of this team’s core.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nWith Darius Garland and Max Strus out, the Cavs will likely have Sam Merrill and De’Andre Hunter in the starting lineup to start the season. Garland’s absence should also lead to more playmaking opportunities for Evan Mobley, who averaged more assists per 36 minutes in the preseason (5.1) than Donovan Mitchell (4.5). Lonzo Ball played 46 preseason minutes, averaged 10.1 assists per 36, and might also be an option (more to close than start games) alongside Mitchell in the backcourt.\n\n\nHunter averaged 32.7 points per 36 minutes in the preseason and could certainly remain in the starting lineup when Strus returns. He never got much of a chance to play alongside the Cavs’ best players last season, logging a total of just 45 minutes (regular season + playoffs) with Garland, Mitchell, Mobley and Jarrett Allen after arriving at the trade deadline.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Switching. As the Cavs lost to the Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals, they often had issues after switching ball screens. Sometimes, Allen struggled to defend on the perimeter. Other times, Indiana was able to take advantage of mismatches inside. If they switch against the Knicks on Wednesday, Mitchell Robinson (who played in just one game vs. Cleveland last year) could certainly kill the Cavs’ guards and wings on the glass.\nThe Cavs will play their first 13 (and 19 of their first 22) games within the Eastern Conference, with the marquee matchup coming Wednesday in New York.

Mitchell Robinson started alongside Karl-Anthony Towns in the three games that both were available, and the Knicks allowed just 35 points on 49 defensive possessions (71 per 100) in their 24 minutes on the floor together.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: The shot clock. The Knicks can make things easier on themselves by just getting into their offense a little faster. Earlier initiation leads to better shots, and they should want to lower the percentage of theirs (22% last season, 27% in the playoffs) that come in the last six seconds of the shot clock.\nThe Knicks finished 13 games behind first-place Cleveland last season and allowed 123.5 points per 100 possessions as they went 0-4 in the season series.

But the next step could be the toughest, especially given the talent in Oklahoma City and Denver.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nAnthony Edwards saw a huge leap in 3-point rate (3PA/FGA) from 2023-24 (34.1%) to last season (50.3%). In the preseason, he was back down to 37.3% (19 of his 51 shots), and overall, the Wolves saw the league’s second biggest drop from last season. Only Brandon Ingram took more mid-range shots in the preseason than Edwards, who was just 5-for-15 from between the paint and the 3-point line.\n\n\nThe Wolves need either Rob Dillingham or Terrence Shannon Jr. to produce off the bench, but their time on the floor wasn’t great. Against NBA opponents, Minnesota was outscored by 46 points in Dillingham’s 116 preseason minutes and by 16 points in Shannon’s 88 minutes.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Closing time. The Wolves had the Western Conference’s second best point differential last season, but finished sixth in the standings, because they were 20-26 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes, ranking 24th in clutch defense for the second straight year. A top-four seed in the West will likely require better results in close games.\nThe Wolves lost both ends of a back-to-back in Portland last November, scoring just 102 points per 100 possessions over those 48 minutes.

They outscored their NBA opponents by 24 points in 37 total minutes with at least three of Chris Paul, Kris Dunn, John Collins and Brook Lopez on the floor, though it certainly helped that Collins and Lopez combined to shoot 10-for-16 from 3-point range over those three games. The Clips’ bench ranked just 12th last season, so the added depth could be a real boost.\n\n\nThe Clips ranked last in pace, and the pace was slowest (93.5 possessions per 48 minutes) with Paul on the floor. Their two leading transition scorers from last season – Powell and Amir Coffey – are gone, so they may be getting a lot fewer fast-break opportunities.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Bradley Beal. The contract shouldn’t define the player, but Beal in LA feels a lot different than Beal in Phoenix. It’s a fresh start for the 32-year-old, who could be a real difference maker for a team that had a middle-of-the-pack offense last season.\nThe Clippers have a great opportunity to get off to a great start. Eight of their first 10 games are against teams that had losing records last season and, after they open in Utah, they’ll play eight of their next 10 at home.

In total, Sengun played 41 (57%) of his 72 minutes alongside either Adams or Clint Capela, and (not unexpectedly) the Rockets had some ridiculous offensive rebounding numbers with the double-big lineups.\n\n\nWith big lineups come mismatches.

The Rockets will have some incredible transition sequences where they turn defense into offense. But if they’re not running, having Thompson, Durant, Smith or Sengun handling the ball could certainly be an issue against the Thunder, whose 10.2 steals per 100 possessions last season were the most for any team in the last 12 years.\nThe Rockets are playing just four games in the first 11 days of the season and, after visiting Oklahoma City on ring night, they’ll play their next four against the Eastern Conference.

Moses Moody was the only other Warrior to play alongside the trio for a majority of those 27 minutes, but he’s dealing with a calf issue and will miss the season opener. So Steve Kerr could go a lot of ways with the other two spots in his lineup, with one possible starter being Jonathan Kuminga, who’s still here. Kuminga didn’t shoot poorly, but he scored just 13.7 points per 36 minutes in the preseason, down from 22.2 per 36 over the last two (regular) seasons.\n\n\nThe Warriors saw the league’s fifth biggest jump in pace from last season (17th) to the preseason (fifth). And the pace was fastest (113.3 possessions per 48 minutes) with Curry on the floor. Curry (9.1), Buddy Hield (7.3) and Gary Payton II (7.3) all ranked in the top eight in fast break points per 36 minutes among the 340 players who played at least 50 minutes total.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: 3-point shooting. Curry is the best shooter in the history of the game, but Butler and Green aren’t scaring defenses from the outside and the Warriors will need other guys to make shots.

The team that’s had a bottom-10 offense in a remarkable 13 straight seasons ranked second on that end of the floor, and that wasn’t about hot shooting. Orlando led the preseason in both free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage. Franz Wagner had 20 free throw attempts with just 27 field goal attempts, and he made 19 of the 20.

The first step toward an improved offense is with additional opportunities in transition.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: The offense. The preseason doesn’t count, so the Magic’s offense will still be under the microscope in the games that do.

His free throw rate (57 attempts per 100 shots from the field) was also more than double his rate from last season (22 per 100).\n\n\nEven if you take away their win over the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, the Spurs would have ranked as the most improved rebounding team in the preseason, having grabbed 54.7% of available rebounds over their four games against NBA opponents.

That’s mostly about health, but there are also questions about Paul George’s ability to return to form (when he returns from injury) and what they have with their young backcourt.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nJoel Embiid made his return in the Sixers’ preseason finale on Friday, registering 14 points, seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals. After throwing up a terrible shot just five seconds into the game, he looked relatively healthy and comfortable, and that he was a full participant in practice on Sunday is a good sign for the week ahead. Paul George also practiced, but his status for the opener on Wednesday seems doubtful.\n\n\nThe Sixers’ win over Minnesota on Friday came with the Wolves sitting their top eight guys.

Maxey averaged 32.1 points per 36 minutes over the four games total, shooting 17-for-22 (77%) in the paint.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Embiid’s rim protection. A healthy Embiid is one of the best defensive anchors in the league. The Sixers’ Week 1 opponents – Boston and Charlotte – aren’t huge threats at the rim, but if Embiid’s teammates trust that he’s got their back, they can better defend the perimeter.\nThe Sixers will play 19 of their first 20 games within the Eastern Conference.

So it’s a big “proof of concept” year in Toronto, and what should be a fascinating experiment on both ends of the floor.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nThe Raptors were super aggressive defensively, with Jakob Poeltl playing up at the level of the screen and blind-side double-teams that turned into layups for them (off of turnovers) or their opponents (because two guys were on the ball). This looks like a feast-or-famine defense that could challenge the Thunder for the league in opponent turnover rate (they forced 22.4 per 100 possessions in the preseason) while also yielding a lot of good shots on the weak side of the floor.\n\n\nPoeltl missed the first four games, but the rest of the starting lineup was healthy. The Raptors scored just 114 points on 107 possessions (106.5 per 100) in 49 total minutes with the foursome of Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett, Brandon Ingram and Scottie Barnes on the floor together, taking just 29 (30%) of their 97 shots from 3-point range (while also registering a low free throw rate) in those minutes.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Ball and player movement. The Raptors ranked in the top six in both ball and player movement last season, but are now trying to integrate a player – Ingram – who’s been assisted on just 47% of his field goals over his nine seasons in the league.\nThe Raptors will play nine of their first 13 games on the road, with a big test in Atlanta on Wednesday. They swept a two-game series at State Farm Arena last season and held the Hawks to less than 108 points per 100 possessions over three games overall.\nWeek 1: @ ATL, vs. MIL, @ DAL']"

Only 22 (23%) of those 96 minutes came alongside Kel’el Ware, but the second-year center did start the last two games. The Heat allowed a concerning 61 points on 47 possessions (130 per 100) in those 22 minutes with the two bigs on the floor together, even though the opponents shot just 7-for-21 (33%) from 3-point range.\n\n\nThe Heat ranked last in 3-point rate, taking only 34.1% of their preseason shots from beyond the arc. Their leaders in 3-point attempts per 36 minutes last season were Duncan Robinson (gone), Herro (injured) and Alec Burks (gone).\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Nikola Jović and Jaime Jaquez Jr. The Heat need one of their young forwards to pop. Jović should have additional playmaking responsibility and could be a Most Improved candidate. Jaquez can also contribute in multiple ways and needs to recover from a second-year drop-off.\nHerro is likely out for at least a dozen games and the Heat have a tough start to their schedule, with six of their first eight on the road and seven of the eight against teams that should be pretty good.\nOff we go on another Miami Heat, NBA adventure.\nWeek 1: @ ORL, @ MEM, vs. NYK']"

But the focus should remain on their young core for at least one more season.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nWith a lot of teams saying they wanted to play faster, the Blazers were the team that followed through the best. They led the preseason in pace by a wide margin, seeing the biggest jump from last season, when they ranked 16th. But their opponents averaged more fast break points per 100 possessions (15.7) than they did (14.5).\n\n\nHoliday didn’t see a big usage-rate jump from his two seasons in Boston and the Blazers were generally good with their starters on the floor. But they got off to rough starts in both the first and third quarters in Utah on Thursday, trailing 19-11 in the first half and getting outscored 15-5 to start the second half.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Shaedon Sharpe’s efficiency. On Sunday, Sharpe became the seventh (of 22) eligible fourth-year players to ink a rookie-scale extension. He averaged 18.5 points per game last season, looking a little more like the Blazers’ two guard of the future. But he can still be much more efficient, with plenty of room for improvement regarding his 3-point shooting (31.1%) and free throw rate (22 attempts per 100 shots from the field).\nThe Blazers were 8-20 against the West’s eight playoff teams last season, and they’ll begin this season with four straight against that group.

They were without Coby White (calf strain) for the entire preseason, but he could be available for their season opener on Wednesday.

But New Orleans was outscored by 21 points (39 per 100 possessions) in 24 minutes with him, Murphy and Williamson on the floor together.\n\n\nOverall (including against non-NBA opponents), the Pelicans ranked second in the percentage of their shots (57%) that came in the paint and 29th in the percentage (37%) that came from 3-point range. But they somehow had just two free throw attempts in those 24 minutes with Jones, Murphy and Williamson on the floor.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Williamson’s defense. The Pelicans have good defenders on the wing and at the center position (especially once Kevon Looney gets healthy), so if Williamson is engaged on that end of the floor (he had four steals in 23 minutes against Houston), their defense should rank closer to what it did in both 2022-23 and ’23-24 (sixth) than it did last season (29th).\nWilliamson and Ja Morant have faced each other just eight times over their six seasons in the league, and not since Dec. 26, 2023.

They forced an incredible 27.4 turnovers per 100 possessions in 59 minutes with both guys on the floor, but Dillon Brooks (6.7) and Ryan Dunn (6.2) were two of the eight players who played at least 50 preseason minutes and committed more than six fouls per 36.\n\n\nHe only played against the Nets and the Dončić-less Lakers, but the Suns outscored their opponents by 18.9 points per 100 possessions in Devin Booker’s 79 minutes.

Last season, the Suns were outscored by 8.2 points per game in the restricted area, the league’s biggest discrepancy by a huge margin. The departures of Beal and Durant should make them less of a jump-shooting team, while Mark Williams (who missed the entire preseason) gives them some additional rim protection.\nThe Suns will play their first 12 games within the Western Conference, with a tough weekend back-to-back where they’ll visit the Clippers and Nuggets.

But they were better after that and, ultimately, scored 128 points per 100 possessions in 68 total minutes with LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller on the floor together. Taking 32 (73%) of his 44 shots of his shots from 3-point range (up from 53% last season), Ball had an effective field goal percentage of 71.6%, the fourth best mark among 104 players with at least 35 field goal attempts.\n\n\nRookie Ryan Kalkbrenner started two games before giving way to Moussa Diabaté in the preseason finale.

This should be the second straight season that the Hornets rank in the top 10 on the offensive glass.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Shot quality.

The Wizards (15 and 18 wins in the last two seasons) probably aren’t going to make that kind of leap collectively, but they do have a lot of players with the potential to show individual improvement.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nLast season, Alex Sarr took just 50% of his shots in the paint and had a free-throw rate of just 19.9 attempts per 100 shots from the field. He played just 40 minutes in the preseason, but played a little bigger, taking eight of his 13 shots in the paint and getting to the line for 10 free throw attempts, though he also struggled a bit (2-for-8 from the field) against the Pistons’ physicality on Thursday.\n\n\nCJ McCollum and Khris Middleton should both be in the starting lineup to start the season and, hopefully, shooting better from mid-range than they did in the preseason (1-for-7 combined). The Wizards were the only team to rank in the bottom 10 in field goal percentage in the paint (21st), mid-range field goal percentage (26th) and 3-point percentage (22nd) in the preseason.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: The second-year guys. The Wizards have nine former first-round picks who are still on their rookie contracts. That includes four from the 2024 Draft, and all four – Sarr, Bub Carrington, AJ Johnson and Kyshawn George – are intriguing in regard to their second-year development.\nThe Wizards were 2-28 against Eastern Conference playoff teams last season, and they’ve lost 18 of their last 21 games against the Bucks.

The intrigue is with their five rookie first round picks.\nPreseason takeaways\n\nOver their three games against NBA teams, the Nets committed 25.6 turnovers per 100 possessions and 32 more total turnovers than their opponents. With rookies handling the ball, they’re going to struggle just getting into their offense at times. But Egor Dëmin actually settled things down and looked pretty competent in his first preseason action on Friday in Toronto, even making a couple of good defensive plays.\n\n\nCam Thomas took some ridiculous shots (making a few as he scored 14 first-quarter points in the first Macao game), and he was assisted on only three of his 16 preseason buckets. But both he and Michael Porter Jr. kept their usage rates under 28%, and Thomas had six assists to Porter in their 79 minutes on the floor together.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Stops and transition. The Nets can alleviate some of the pressure on their rookie point guards by getting stops and keeping their opponents from setting up defensively. Terrance Mann can defend on the perimeter and Nic Claxton is a solid anchor, but it takes more than two good defenders to get stops consistently.\nThe Nets’ first game – Wednesday in Charlotte – is probably one of their most winnable games of the season.

The Jazz scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions (and allowed 132 per 100!) in his 81 minutes.\n\n\nThe Jazz had the league’s second-lowest turnover rate in the preseason, noteworthy given that they’ve ranked last in turnover rate in each of the last two seasons, with their 17.0 per 100 possessions last season being the highest rate for any team in the last nine years. But they still averaged 8.3 fewer shooting opportunities than their opponents (the league’s worst discrepancy), because they were in the bottom four in opponent turnover rate, offensive rebounding percentage and defensive rebounding percentage. The Jazz are obviously going to be at a talent disadvantage most nights, but not getting killed in the margins would be a good first step toward being competitive.\n\nSomething to watch in Week 1: Guard play.
